            <p>This page highlights the important 
            developments that I have done in different areas of programming. Some examples include working with website 
            security and encryption, and full stack development from front end UI to database programming.</p>

            <br />
            <p>This project was a fully functional website with a sign in members area programmed in PHP and uses MySQL databases. 
                It has data encryption, file encryption, web seurity, and is one of the most involved projects that required 
                integration of the company's old VBA databases.</p>
            
            <br />
            <p>
                Languages: PHP, Jquery, VBA, HTML/CSS
                <br />Templates: Customized Wordpress
                <br />Databases: MySQL, VBA
                <br />Data Encryption: SSL Security, AES Rijndael cipher
                <br />File Encryption: PDF files, AES Encrypt/Decrypt

                <u>Noteboard</u>
                <br />This noteboard was created on the subdomain for the company to communicate internally using a members area. Each member were allowed to leave a message on the noteboard allow all members to view and respond to. As messages were posted, an email system notified all members and were allowed to easily respond using the email link. Members could further upload documents, images, and change their profile photo.
                <br />Languages: PHP, Jquery, HTML/CSS
                <br />Database: MySQL
                <br />Security: SSL, internal company IP access only using htaccess file
            </p>

                <u>Zoho V2 API Integration</u>
                <br />This project involved writing a custom class to handle the token security that Zoho V2 required for web based interactions (search, insert, modify, etc). The token expired every hour, so database tables were required for handling and resuing tokens for optimal performance.
                Further, CSV files were created and exported to a secure location for integrating with the Bluehornet API (see below).
                <br />Language: PHP
                <br />Database: MySQL
            </p>

                <u>Bluehornet API</u>
                <br />This project involved writing a custom class for downloading data from Bluehornet as well as direct data updates using VBA over HTTPS.
                <br />Language: PHP, VBA
                <br />Database: MySQL
